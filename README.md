James Hollowell! Yahooo!

    ./client <adress> <port>
    ./server <port>

Current Issues:
	- I: server prints out strange ? aski character after client runs
		>S: David is currentley looking at probable causes

        James: It is probably due to the client sending a random number not a char

	- I: server is not broken into proper classes
		>S: David & Jeremy are deciding on class structures

	- I: having trouble passing the socket into the pthread_create function
             for use in the threaded function
		>S: no solution yet
